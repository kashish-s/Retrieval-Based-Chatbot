# Retrieval-Based-Chatbot

The chatbot is a simple pattern recognition based model. The dataset has intents in which specific inputs have been tagged into different categories.
According to the user input, specific responses are randomly selected by the chatbot as replies.
The bag of words is used as input to the model.
Chatbot was created using a sequential model.
Weights for a high accuracy have been downloaded which are then used in the flask file to give a response.
